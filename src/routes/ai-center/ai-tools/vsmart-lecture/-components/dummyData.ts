                "Good morning, class! Today, we're going to explore something we experience every day—**Light**. Have you ever wondered what light really is? Light is a form of energy that helps us see the world around us. It travels in straight lines and can pass through some materials while being blocked by others. Without light, we wouldn't be able to see colors, shapes, or even each other! Can you think of any natural or artificial sources of light?",

                "Now, let's understand how light moves. Light travels in **straight lines**, and this property is called **rectilinear propagation**. Imagine a torchlight—when you shine it, the beam goes straight unless something blocks it. But what happens when light hits a mirror? It bounces back! This is called **reflection**. We'll explore reflection in detail later. For now, let's do a quick experiment: Take a comb and a torch. Shine the torch through the comb's teeth—what do you observe? The light travels in straight lines, right?",

There are two important laws of reflection:  \n      1. **The angle of incidence = angle of reflection** (both are measured from the normal, an imaginary perpendicular line).  \n      2. **The incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie on the same plane**.  \n      Let's try an activity: Use a small mirror and a laser pointer. Shine the laser at the mirror and observe how it reflects. Can you measure the angles?",

                "Now, let's talk about **refraction**. Have you ever noticed how a straw in a glass of water appears bent? That's because light changes speed when it moves from one medium (like air) to another (like water), causing it to bend. This bending is called **refraction**. The amount of bending depends on the material's **optical density**. For example, light bends more in glass than in water. Let's do a quick demo: Place a pencil in a glass of water and observe how it looks bent!",
